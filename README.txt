In order to test the Maze Solver, ensure that the .txt file containing maze to be solved is saved in the same location as the Maze Solver.

In the code, specify the name of the maze you wish to run and replace input.txt with it.

For example, if your file was called mymaze, then the line would need to be:

	 String fileName = "mymaze.txt";

Alternatively, you can replace mymaze.txt with the full file path of the location of the file. For Example:

	String fileName = "C:\\Users\\Krysten\\Desktop\\Gentrack Maze Technical Test_V4\\Gentrack Maze Technical Test\\Samples\\input.txt";

If successful, the maze will print to the console showing the path needed to solve it.

If unsuccessful, the console will return "This maze is unsolvable."
